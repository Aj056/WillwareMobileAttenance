# Dashboard Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Removed Dashboard Overview Stats Section**
- Removed the entire stats grid showing:
  - Today Hours, Active Staff, Total Hours
  - Team Overview with Total Employees and Checked In Today
- Simplified data loading to only fetch required information
- Cleaned up unused state variables and API calls

### ✅ **Fixed Quotes Display Issue**
- **Problem**: Quotes showing as empty `"" —` 
- **Root Cause**: API property mismatch (external API uses `text`/`author` vs internal `Quote`/`Author`)
- **Solution**: Added fallback property access:
  ```typescript
  <Text style={styles.quoteText}>"{currentQuote.text || currentQuote.Quote}"</Text>
  <Text style={styles.quoteAuthor}>— {currentQuote.author || currentQuote.Author}</Text>
  ```

### ✅ **Optimized Performance**
- Removed unnecessary API calls to `/allemp` endpoint
- Simplified dashboard data loading
- Reduced data processing for unused statistics
- Maintained essential functionality (attendance tracking, quotes, time display)

## Current Dashboard Layout

The dashboard now shows only:
1. **Header** - Welcome message and logout button
2. **Live Clock** - Current time and date
3. **Attendance Status** - Check-in/out status with hours
4. **Motivational Quote** - Working quotes with proper display

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Interface**: Less cluttered, more focused on essential information
- **Better Performance**: Fewer API calls and data processing
- **Working Quotes**: Proper display of motivational content
- **Maintained Functionality**: All core features still working

The app is now streamlined and user-friendly with working quotes display!
